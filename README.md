This fork of Brushes is made with the goal to have a working app after the iOS 8 update, which broke read/write funcionality in the app. The original developer Steve Sprang has been off-grid since March 2014 (I hope he is OK) and until he's back I'll update this fork and app which goes under the name Brushes Redux on the App Store.
Also I would like to hear from the other contributors to the original Brushes project, [Scott Vachalek](https://github.com/svachalek) and [Joe Ricioppo](https://github.com/joericioppo). They might be able to update the original app which of cause would be the ideal solution for everyone.
