How to Contribute
-----------------

One of my motivations for releasing the source code for Brushes was to make it a community project. To that end, I'd appreciate help with bug fixes, localizations, testing, and ideas for improving/simplifying existing code. Take a look at the list of [issues](https://github.com/sprang/Brushes/issues) to find enhancements that I've considered implementing.

If you're taking on a big change, I'd be happy to discuss design ideas or answer questions before you get too far along. Note: I will likely be picky about implementation details and UI changes.
